 		<h3><strong>Our Story:</strong><h3>
 			<p><strong>We Recruiters have a problem.</strong> If we don't fill our positions, then it's our fault. Simple. The only thing standing in between our agency making money and us losing our jobs is our ability to network and put a good search string together. We thought to ourselves: "there has to be more," and as it turns out, a select few of us have actually been using a gamechanging method for quite some time. It's safe to say that we're the top performers at our agencies because of it. The good news is that our competitive advantage isn't exclusive to us. Everyone could benefit from this method and the more Recruiters that join, the stronger the system becomes. </p>
 			<p>We are a group of Recruiters who are fortunate enough to have forged relationships with Recruiters from competing agencies. When you have a relationship with a Recruiter who has access to an entirely different candidate database, your resources double. For example, when a Recruiter from a different agency was stuck on a position they couldn't find the right candidate for, they would reach out to us and ask if we had any relevant resumes that we could send them. If at that time we didn't have any open jobs that one of our candidates would be a good fit for but saw a clear fit for the other Recruiter's needs, we would send them over. They would of course do the same for us and as a result, countless of our jobs have been filled because of it. This system has been proven to work and so we built Jobfill so that you can join in our success.</p>

		<h3><strong>Jobfill:</strong><h3>
   		<p>Jobfill is a resume trading platform that was built by Recruiters for Recruiters. Our mission is simple: to fill jobs. We strive to become the go-to platform for agency and freelance Recruiters who want to increase the amount of jobs they fill and earn more money.</p> 

   		<p>With Jobfill, you're no longer dependant on your own individual recruiting skills, but you are now apart of a network of likeminded Recruiters that can now add value to your unused resumes.</p>

		<h3><i>On a personal note...</i></h3>
   		<p><i>We built this for two reasons. To help other Recruiters and to help ourselves. This system only works if we all work together and support each other. That's why we need you to give us as much feedback and suggestions as you possibly can. Do you have a specific feature that you think would help you? Tell us so we can build it for you. We want you to become the most successful Recruiter you can be.</i></p>
